<!-- This image was added to remind me to respect my app journey and celebrate my pace. When I conceptualized my app initially it had more functionality. I took my instructors advice and choose to strive for MVP for the duration of the sprint. Doing so and coding out every part from scratch made me digest my code better seeing the flow and processing code which I can I didn't fully digest at times in class.-->
